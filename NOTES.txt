we will cover
-------------
	- spring core
	- spring mvc
	- spring boot
	- spring data jpa with hibernate
	- spring rest api
	- mongodb

Spring core
-----------
	- IOC
	- DI
   - configuration of the beans can be done in 3 ways
    --------------------------------------------------
	- xml based configuration
	- annotation based configuration
	- java based configuration

   - what type of project we need?
    ------------------------------
	- spring boot project with maven ( the main reason is to manage our jar files)
	- and we will use spring initializer website to create this spring boot maven project
	- and then download and import this project into eclipse

spring mvc or spring web mvc
----------------------------
	- here we are creating web applications
	- a web application is a group of web pages
	- this web page can be a static page(HTML) or a dynamic page(HTML with JSP(Java Server Pages) or Thymeleaf)
	- this web application which we create has to be deployed in a web server(Tomcat)
	- who is the client? - browser
	- it follows a client server architecture - a client send a request to the server. The server process the request and sends a response back to the client.

	- what type of project we need?
		- spring boot project with maven
		- we will ad the spring starter web dependency to the spring boot project
		- by adding this dependency we can work with spring mvc, spring rest api and also an embedded tomcat server
		- as usual use spring intilizer, download the project and import in eclipse
M - Model
	- the data that you hold in your web application
	- we use a POJO(Plain Old Java Object)
	- also known as DO(Data Object), TO(Transfer Object), VO(Value Object)
V - View
	- UI of the web application which means the web page
	- we do input and output here
	- we use HTML and JSP or thymeleaf
C - Controller
	- manager of the web application
	- we use Servlet

spring boot
-----------
	- quickly created a project using spring initializer
	- auto configuration
	- production ready project - profiles for different environment, actuators to monitor the project performance, logging etc


project
-------
	- 3 layered project
	- the request comes to the controller, then the controller calls the service, then service calls the dao, then the dao interacts with the DB
	- and dao returns data to the service, service returns that data to the controller and the controller send the data to the view which will rendered and returned back
	- the 3 layers are
		- controller
			- manager
			- has the request handler methods
		- service
			- here we write the business logic 
		- dao (Data Access Object)
			- here we write the Database interactions

spring rest api
---------------
	- we create REST web service
	- we create a backend application for a full stack application using spring rest api
	- who is the client? - the front end application
	- do we have the front end application? no, so we use some tools as client to test the endpoints created by our spring rest backend application
	- what are those tools to test the endpoints?
		- Postman
		- swagger
		- thunder client
		

a request contains 2 parts - request header and request body
a response contains 2 parts - response header and response body


h2 Database
-----------
	- a relational database software
	- in memory database software
	- we can add this database a maven dependency to our spring boot project

ORM/Hibnernate/JPA
------------------
	- dao layer uses hibernate with JPA
	- ORM : Object Relational Mapping
		- ORM is a concept
	- JPA : Jakarta Persistence API
		- a specification for ORM
	- Hibernate
		- is a ORM framework
	
	- here an entity class/object is mapped to a relation in the Database

association mapping
	- one to one
	- one to many
	- many to one
	- many to many

from author to book the relation is one to many
from book to author the relation is many to one

spring data JPA
